## What Stays on Your Device

- **Audio recordings** - Raw audio is processed locally and deleted immediately. Only detected bird clips are saved.
- **Detection data** - Bird species, timestamps, and confidence scores stored in a local database.
- **Location** - Your coordinates are stored locally to help filter species predictions.
- **Settings & passwords** - All configuration stays on your device. Passwords are securely hashed.

## What We Don't Collect

| Feature | Service | What's Sent |
|---------|---------|-------------|
